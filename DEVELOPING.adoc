== Setting up

The project can be imported into IntelliJ IDEA. There are two default run configurations:

* `lexer parser` Regenerates the lexer and the parser
* `Run IntelliJ` Recompiles the plugin ands starts an IDE with the plugin, can be used for debugging.

== Grammar

To work on grammar, the link:https://github.com/JetBrains/Grammar-Kit[Grammar-Kit] plugin needs to be installed. The grammar for the parser is defined in link:src/main/grammars/solidity.bnf[solidity.bnf], and the corresponding lexer is defined in link:src/main/grammars/_SolidityLexer.flex[_SolidityLexer.flex].

When working on grammar, it's convenient to use the `Live Preview` and `Structure view`, see the link:https://github.com/JetBrains/Grammar-Kit#general-usage-instructions[usage instructions] for the Grammar-Kit.

It's important to remember that running the tests from IDE doesn't regenerate the grammar, so every time the lexer or parser are changed, `lexer parser` run configuration needs to be run.

== Formatting

The implementation of the formatter aims to follow the link:https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/style-guide.rst[official style guide] by default, but also to be configurable to step away from the conventions when needed.

The formatting rules are defined in `src/main/kotlin/com/broxus/solidity/ide/formatting`, with the corresponding tests in `src/test/kotlin/com/broxus/solidity/ide/formatting`. The official link:https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/custom_language_support/formatter.html[JetBrains documentation] can be used as a reference.
