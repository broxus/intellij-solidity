**T-Sol** (short for **Threaded Solidity**) JetBrains IDEs plugin is designed to make writing TVM-based smart contracts more comfortable and faster. It is based on [Sergey Tselovalnikov](https://github.com/SerCeMan)'s [original Solidity plugin](https://github.com/intellij-solidity/intellij-solidity) (kudos!) and features syntax prompts and autofilling while writing code. The plugin is also open-source and was released under the MIT license.

T-Sol proposes Threaded Solidity, the new name for TVM-based Solidity and works with files with the `.tsol` extension, making it easier to navigate between EVM and TVM smart contract files, which previously had the same `.sol` extension.
